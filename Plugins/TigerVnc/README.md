### Introduction

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system
that allows you to view and interact with a desktop environment
that is running on a remote computer.
Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a remote machine
and send only the pixels generated by those applications
to your local machine. VNC is platform-independent
and supports a wide variety of operating systems
and architectures as both servers and clients.
